# Jep!
Simple Jeopardy game in Python using the PyQt5 framework.
I made this primarily for usage with my friends for use over
video chats, where I serve as the host and they buzz in their
answers.

## Overview
Below is a screenshot of the program. The game is played the same as
normal Jeopardy. If you don't know how to play Jeopardy, see
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!)

The game controls are detailed below.

## Dependencies
This project depends heavily on the PyQt5 framework.
In order to play the sounds, the mpv media player must
be installed on your system as well.

## Controls
The game is controlled primarily through the keyboard, with the mouse
being used to click on the clues.
