# Jep!
Simple Jeopardy game in Python using the PyQt6 framework. I made this primarily for use with my
friends for use over video chats, where I serve as the host and they buzz in their answers. As such
I do not (and probably will not) validate input, handle certain things automatically, or do other
"defensive" programming tasks. Others are free to fork and make this more robust, but it's just a
small program for personal use so I don't care to validate that your wager is a number (for
example).

## Overview
Below is a screenshot of the program. The game is played the same as normal Jeopardy. If you don't
know how to play Jeopardy, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!)

## Dependencies
This project uses PyQt6 so you will need that. You will also need the QMultimedia package to play
the sounds.
